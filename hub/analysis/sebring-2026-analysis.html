              The 2026 12 Hours of Sebring delivered exactly what we've come to
              expect from America's toughest endurance race: controversy,
              incredible battles, and machinery pushed to breaking point. Here's
              our complete breakdown of how the race unfolded.
            </p>

            <h2>Pre-Race Context</h2>

            <p>
              Coming off the Daytona 24, the IMSA paddock arrived at Sebring
              with clear championship implications. The GTP class featured eight
              factory-supported entries, with Porsche Penske Motorsport carrying
              momentum from their Daytona result.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sebring's notorious concrete-patched surface would test both
              mechanical reliability and driver endurance. The circuit punishes
              mistakes more severely than any other on the calendar.
            </p>

            <h2>Opening Hours: Setting the Pace</h2>

            <p>
              The Cadillac V-Series.R entries came out swinging, leading the
              opening stint and setting a pace that forced rivals into reactive
              mode. Their straight-line speed advantage at Sebring—particularly
              through the long back straights—proved significant.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, tire degradation told a different story. By hour two, the
              Porsches had moved forward as their more conservative early-race
              approach began paying dividends.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                "We knew we couldn't match Cadillac's opening pace. Our strategy
                was always to be there when it mattered—at the end."
              </p>
              <cite>— Porsche Penske Motorsport strategist</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Midday Chaos</h2>

            <p>
              Hour five brought the race's defining moment. A multi-car incident
              at Turn 17 eliminated two GTP contenders and bunched the field
              behind an extended full-course caution.
            </p>

            <p>
              Strategic decisions during this caution period would prove
              decisive. Some teams opted for full service stops; others
              prioritized track position. When racing resumed, the order was
              dramatically reshuffled.
            </p>

            <h2>The BMW Breakthrough</h2>

            <p>
              BMW's M Hybrid V8 has shown flashes of competitiveness throughout
              its development, but Sebring 2026 represented a significant step
              forward. The #25 entry ran consistently in the top three during
              the middle portion of the race, demonstrating both pace and
              reliability.
            </p>

            <p>
              Though they wouldn't ultimately reach the podium, the performance
              signaled that BMW's patient development approach is beginning to
              yield results.
            </p>

            <h2>Late-Race Drama</h2>

            <p>
              With two hours remaining, three cars were separated by less than
              30 seconds. The tension was palpable as teams made final strategic
              calculations—fuel loads, tire compound choices, and driver
              selections for the finishing stint.
            </p>

            <p>
              A late caution with 45 minutes remaining created a restart
              scenario that produced some of the most intense racing of the
              entire season. Position swaps happened nearly every lap through
              the final 30 minutes.
            </p>

            <h2>The Finish</h2>

            <p>
              The checkered flag fell on a result that will be debated for
              years. The winning margin was minuscule, and post-race technical
              inspections created additional drama before results were declared
              final.
            </p>

            <p>
              What cannot be debated is the spectacle. Sebring delivered
              entertainment value that justified its reputation as America's
              greatest endurance race.
            </p>

            <h2>GTD Class Highlights</h2>

            <p>
              While GTP garnered headlines, the GTD class produced arguably the
              race's best battle. The final-hour fight between three GT3
              machines—representing three different manufacturers—showcased
              everything great about Pro-Am endurance racing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Amateur drivers, thrust into pressure-cooker situations, delivered
              performances that belied their "bronze" ratings. The emotional
              celebrations on the podium reflected the significance of their
              achievements.
            </p>

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

            <p>
              Sebring results reshape championship projections. The manufacturer
              battle remains incredibly tight, with no clear favorite emerging
              through two rounds. This sets up an intriguing remainder of the
              IMSA season.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next up: Long Beach, where the street circuit will present
              completely different challenges. Teams have mere weeks to pivot
              their development focus.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <h2>Championship Implications</h2>

            <p>
              With Sebring complete, the GTP championship standings see Porsche
              Penske extending their advantage. However, the midfield remains
              incredibly close, with only 15 points separating positions 2-5 in
              the manufacturer standings.
